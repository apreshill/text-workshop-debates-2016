    "`nltk` comes with the Carnegie-Mellon pronounciation dictionary, which has pretty good English coverage (â‰ˆ134k words). It lets us translate a lexical item (e.g. \"monkey\") into ARPAbet (e.g. \"M AH1 NG K IY0\"). In Arpabet, the numbers at the end of the vowel phonemes indicate which are pronounced as stressed vowels. Obviously, in reality, pronounciation will vary according to accent, etc., but this is a \"good enough\" place to start. \n",
